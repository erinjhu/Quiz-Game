Why is there an inward acceleration for uniform circular motion?
Since a = delta(v)/t, the resultant vector's direction will be inwards
There is only outward acceleration if the reference frame is an accelerated reference frame
To ensure the motion is uniform, acceleration must be towards the center of the circular path
Centripetal acceleration is perpendicular to the non-tangential velocity
Since a = delta(v)/t, the resultant vector's direction will be inwards
Which direction will the cork lean in when the cork accelerometer (corks suspended in a glass jar of water)?
In the direction of the acceleration
Opposite to the acceleration
In the direction of the velocity
Opposite to the velocity
In the direction of the acceleration
What is the best way to describe the velocity vector?
Constant magnitude and tangential direction
Constant magnitude and central direction
Non-constant magnitude and tangential direction
Constant magnitude and central direction
Constant magnitude and tangential direction
You are holding a ball tied to a 3 cm string, and you start twirling it in a horizontal circle. The initial speed is 0 m/s. After it accelerates for 2 seconds, you are twirling it at a constant speed of 10 m/s. Calculate the magnitude of acceleration for the uniform circular motion.
5 m/s^2
55.55 m/s^2
33.33 m/s^2
3333.33 m/s^2
3333.33 m/s^2
If you double the radius, what will happen to the acceleration and why?
Double; radius is directly proportional to acceleration
Double; radius is indirectly proportional to acceleration
Halve; radius is directly proportional to acceleration
Halve; radius is indirectly proportional to acceleration
Halve; radius is indirectly proportional to acceleration
